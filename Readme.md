### Information on the methodology 

https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Hospital-overall-ratings-calculation.html

The methodology uses a statistical model known as a latent variable model. Seven different latent variable models are used to calculate scores for 7 groups of measures.

    Mortality
    Safety of Care
    Readmission
    Patient Experience
    Effectiveness of Care
    Timeliness of Care
    Efficient Use of Medical Imaging

A hospital summary score is then calculated by taking the weighted average of these group scores. If a hospital is missing a measure category or group, the weights are redistributed amongst the qualifying measure categories or groups.

Finally, the overall hospital rating is calculated using the hospital summary score.
